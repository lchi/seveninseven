* Everything except ```nil``` or ```false``` is false
* && (and) || (or) have short circuit evaluation, to do full eval you can use & and |
* strongly typed (get an error when types mismatch in a bad way)
  * behaves like this most of the time, but u can classes around to defeat type safety, so not quite
* duck typing - related to interfaces in that you code to interface, not to implementation
  * no java type interface, but loose interface by method name??
